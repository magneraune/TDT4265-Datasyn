## Task 3 ##

a)
Non-maximum supression (NMS) removes duplicates predictions of the same same object, in other words removes overlapping boxes.

b)
False. As the resolution of the feature maps gradually decrease, the predictions from the deeper layers are for detecting larger objects.

c)
They use different bounding box aspect ratios at the same spatial location to encourage predictions closer to their default box,
 making the training more stable and to resulting in more diverse predictions.

d)
The main difference between SSD and YOLO is that YOLO uses two fully connected layers for detection, while SSD uses multiple convulutional layers with different sizes.

e)
For this feature map we have:
38*38*6 = 8664 anchor boxes

f)
For the entire network we have:
6*(38*38 + 19*19 + 10*10 + 5*5 + 3*3 + 1*1) = 11640 anchor boxes
